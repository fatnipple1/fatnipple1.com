<p>and uhh Romil, their producer, was setting up the front of the stage as the--as their set was starting</p>
<p>and I was at the front of the crowd so I said "hey Romil!" "take a picture" and I tossed him my disposable camera--I just chucked it onto the stage and he caught it</p>
<p>and he was like "ok" and it took uh-- he like setup the flash and he took a picture of the crowd</p>
<p>and he chucked it back to me and I fumbled it but I got it</p>
<p>and now I have-- and now I have a picture</p>
